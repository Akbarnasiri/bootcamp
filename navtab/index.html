            responsible for drawing in a majority of your website's traffic. Still, despite its prominence, many

            When having someone design your website you want to make sure that they touch on key areas so you get the
            best value out of your website.

            Many times designers are not marketers, which will make your website look great, but often times won't
            convert.

            Below we have listed out ten ideas for your website homepage content to not only appeal to your audience,
            but acquire more leads.

            With the Cone Principle, a website's pages are structured with high-impact visuals and minimal text at the
            top. The pages then gradually introduce more and more detail the further you scroll down. This approach
            allows visitors to quickly and easily scan your homepage to learn who you are, what you do, and how they can
            interact more with your site.
